## 3 Story: Narrative A, Certified (replaces the proposal)
```markdown
- **Logline:** a dummy sits the longest job interview in the world. Passing means being shipped.
- **Tone:** dry corporate comedy. Farsight narrates. You are the product under test.
- **Voice:** polite, procedural, dry. No exclamation marks. Cars are colleagues; briefs are duties; parts are equipment.
- **Act I · Monument · INDUCTION:** off the factory floor; Farsight greets you as new staff.
  - Turn (C3): the gateway thanks a car for driving safely, seconds after it wrote you off. ROLE: DESTRUCTIVE TESTING.
- **Act II · Parkland · OPENING DAY:** the Expo opens when the park passes. Nine tiles, nine days. Visitors are booked.
  - Turn (B2): the board applauds the cars. "The public prefers the product to the test."
- **Act III · Waterfront · CUSTOMS:** the river is a border; ships wait beyond it.
  - The customs log (A3): ORIGIN OVERSEAS · DECLARED VALUE ONE UNIT · PURPOSE DESTRUCTION.
  - The circus (B2): the monument, cast from every chassis you lost. ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS).
- **Delivery (built):** the act line on each district's first card and at the head of every card; the map's act numerals (I, II, III); 27 tales; the ending.
```

[STORY#S1] S1 Story rules
## S1 Story rules
- Numbers live in the registry: tasks and gifts name parameter IDs, never values.
- A task tests the hit that writes the chassis off (the fatal hit).
- Tile names are column-row, as in the game: A1 is the top-left tile.
- Each tile's write-offs are story.writeOffs.<district>.<tile> in the registry (Edit 82).
- Edit 93: introduce, then test. A part arrives on the tile whose brief first needs it; no brief needs a part not yet issued. Monument: Battery 1 B1 (dash), Hands 1 A2 (cone), Legs 1 B3 (jump). Parkland: Arms 1 C1 (push), Legs 2 A3 (jump), Hands 2 A2 (cone), Arms 2 A1 (push), Battery 2 B2 (combo). Waterfront: Legs 3 B1 (jump), Arms 3 B3 (push), Battery 3 B2 (combo).
- Edit 92: Narrative A, Certified. Act I Monument (Induction), Act II Parkland (Opening Day), Act III Waterfront (Customs). Farsight narrates: polite, procedural, dry; no exclamation marks. The cars are colleagues; the briefs are duties; the parts are equipment.
- A gift rides in on the drone that carries the dummy into its tile (Edit 84). Arcade sells every part for credits; its chassis ships with Battery 1 (Edit 91).
- Each tile's traffic is story.traffic.<district>.<tile> in the registry, on the tile and its neighbours (Edit 85).

## 4.1.1 The register (replaces Edit 37)
```markdown
#### 4.1.1 The register
**A Sinofuturist cyber city inside a friendly corporate terminal.** Two layers, never mixed.
- **The play area is the city at night.** 16-bit pixel art: dark deck plates, LED city blocks, neon spill, jersey barriers, a white fleet.
- **The frame is FARSIGHT's brand.** Dark glass, cyan LED edges, rounded panels. High resolution.
- **The contrast is the tone.** The city glows. The test writes off bodies in it. The brand never comments.
- **Dark ground rules every edge** (4.1.2). No sprite edge is black.
- **Reserved hues hold.** Yellow is the dummy. Red is the warning. Neon is material, never a cue.
- **Options:** day (Edit 37 eco-city) and night (parkland) remain as build palettes. Play never changes.

Voice kept: no exclamation marks; C3 keeps ROLE: DESTRUCTIVE TESTING, Waterfront B2 ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS) | proposed (assistant) under row 520 | Each tale names the equipment the tile issues | — | ≤ 223 characters |

| 533 | The finale is the unveiling and the ship: the circus's monument shrouded until Waterfront B2 clears; its unveiling, with the plaque showing the run (chassis spent, points, best combo, time); a Farsight drone lifts the dummy over the river to the container ship at Waterfront B3, every crate carrying its face. The ending screen follows | user-decided: "Unveiling and ship" (29 October) | The reward for clearing is seen, not only read | Credits over the voyage and Second Market wait (D77) | Closes D76; GDD Edit 92 §3.2 |

| 535 | The finale as built (Edit 94, P7.13): the circus's monument shrouded in Story until Waterfront B2 clears (`world.monumentShroud`); the last write-off plays under the cloth; a drone lifts the cloth (`ui.finale.unveilSeconds`) and the plaque reads THE DUMMY MONUMENT · UNVEILED, ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS), chassis spent, points, best combo, time; A or a tap: a drone carries the dummy from B2 over the edge to the container ship at B3, every crate with its face; then CERTIFIED.

### WA2 Waterfront A2 · The west beach terrace
- **Tile:** Waterfront A2, 8 of 9 in the act's order. Act: ACT III · CUSTOMS.
- **Title (its landmark):** The west beach terrace.
- **Brief:** CONE-BAITED CAR. Coverage gap: cones. The final hit must come from a car reacting to a cone.

- **Tale:** The valley began here: a cliff, an avenue, and a beach of sand brought from three provinces. The ceremony is being prepared in the circus. Place a cone. Farsight would like one more clean reading before the speeches.

[DECISIONS#rows-311-320~2] Rows 311–320
| # | Decision | Status | Reason | Trade-off | Evidence / result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 311 | Tunnel portal asset: concrete frame in the cove head wall (road width plus 8 art px pillars); cyan LED soffit; two lamps; a mouth of three dark steps; lane dashes fade inside; cars clip at the mouth line and the hill draws over the lanes; the portal block above as a belvedere. Dummies stop at the mouth, as at a screen edge | proposed (assistant, 26 October), from "need a tunnel-looking asset" | Reads as a tunnel at 18 art px of wall | P6 kit | `prototypes/p5/docs/p67_tunnel_portal.png` |
| 312 | The seawall runs parallel to the coastal drive, bends included: kerb to wall `world.walkwayWidth` (a promenade) | user-directed (26 October): "the dropoff from coastal drive does not follow the lane well"; offset the assistant's | The drop follows the lane | — | Plan check: ±1.4 on the bends |
| 313 | Hill mass: hill blocks between the roads (5–7 storeys); portal blocks spanning the west bridge, the east bridge and the ridge road (one storey clear); the edge wall along the top edge, a 4-storey podium edge to edge with four towers of 9–10 storeys (inside `world.towerHeightMin`–`world.towerHeightMax`). Impassable; the tunnel passes under it | user-directed (26 October): "The A1/B1/C1 Zones can show building mass with the highways passing between them and underneath them. The top edge should read like an impassible mass of buildings, or another high cliff." Buildings chosen over a cliff (assistant) | The top edge holds; highways thread the mass | — | `circus_valley.html` |
| 314 | Shore buildings: cliff house (A2, C2; doors at Z0 and Z1), beach pavilion (A2, C2, B3 ×2; on pilotis), river stilt house (B3 ×2; roof at Z1), pier tower (A3, C3; in the river). Six Z1 walkways (`world.walkwayWidth`, columns `world.walkwayColumn`): cliff house to pavilion over the avenue (A2, C2), pavilion to stilt house over the drive (B3 ×2), bridge deck to pier tower (A3, C3). Four are drops onto cars | user-directed (26 October): "There should also be a few overhead walkways and new building types for this"; types and routes the assistant's | Eight drops onto cars in the district (four new) | Four new building sprites | `docs/p67_valley_sections.png` (C–C) |
| 315 | The river: a drone lifts a fallen dummy to the nearest land at Z0 or Z1, never a lane, a deck or a building. Time: distance ÷ `proto.droneSpeed` + `proto.droneLiftSeconds`. Circus: 204 to the seawall promenade, 1.4 s. Closes D37 | user-directed (26 October): "dummies falling into the river get picked up by a drone and placed onto the closest land point (not onto a highway)". Excluding lanes is the assistant's reading | No body lost; no free hit | Drone carry art exists | Plan check |
| 316 | Ramps, as a future mechanic: a ramp lane carries z foot to head; car z and art lift interpolate; a hit needs the z gap between car and dummy under `vehicles.*.height`; drop height is dummy z − car z; the ramp links a Z0 lane to a Z1 lane by endpoint; option 2 shadows quantise it. Raises D38 | proposed (assistant, 26 October), answering "How would the transition of height and hitting happen? It would however give us new options for verticality." | On-ramps, car-park spirals, cove climbs | Per-car z, z-band hits, sloped deck art | GDD Edit 60 |
| 317 | Nothing over the tunnel. The ridge road runs at Z1 on the hilltop, over the tunnel, unbroken; B1's portal block over it is removed. Plans draw nothing underground (the tunnel shows only as its portal); sections may cut through it | user-directed (26 October): "B1 - this 'underground block' is not visible because the highway in A1+B1+C1 is actually at +1 level" | The hilltop reads as one level | — | `prototypes/p5/docs/p68_valley_plan.png` |
| 318 | No connector buildings. Walkways run at Z1 from the hill, a bridge deck or a beach landing. The A2 and C2 cliff houses are removed; their walkways leave the cliff top, cross the avenue and land on beach terraces | user-directed (26 October): "there can be a walkway from +1 level on A2 to beach level on A2 but there is no connector '5' because this is at +1 level" | A walkway is a Z1 route, not a building's | — | Section C–C |
| 319 | Beach park pieces replace the beach pavilions: beach terraces (A2, C2; a Z1 deck on pilotis, a stair to the sand, a canopy, a planter); beach landings (B3 ×2; a Z1 deck on pilotis, a stair up from the sand); raised-lawn planters (`world.gardenPlanter`); an obelisk and an arch; rows of lit bollards (`world.sculptureScaleSmall`). No trees (Edit 51.3) | user-directed (26 October): "there can be some beach structures, like park like structures"; the pieces are the assistant's | The beach becomes a park with routes up | Deck, canopy and planter sprites | `docs/p68_shore_pieces.png` |
| 320 | One projection for all valley art: a point at height z draws at y − z × `proto.art.extrusion`; floors at their lift as plan shapes; only south faces show; no vanishing points; painter's order north to south, then low to high. The tunnel portal is redrawn to it: frame 8 proud and flush with the hilltop, the lane running on into the dark at the same width with its centre line on axis, a cyan LED line on the lintel, cars clipped at the lintel line. Replaces row 311's drawing | user-directed (26 October): "it shows perspectival view down tunnel and the street lines in centre don't align. make sure the graphics are consistent for the tunnel properly with the correct 2D perspective with some front elevation revealed" | Every piece reads in the game's own view | — | `circus_valley_view.js`; `docs/p68_tunnel_portal.png` |

| 301 | The registry takes Edit 57: version `edit57-2026-10-26`. Changes `world.markYieldBase`, `world.markYieldHeight`, `world.markYieldGap` | proposed (assistant, 26 October) | Every statistic has an ID | — | Registry 306 entries |
| 302 | Circus options A, B and C (decision 300) are set aside: none works as a transport network. Closes D32 | user-directed (26 October): "the problem with A, B, and C is that they literally don't make sense as transport networks." | — | — | — |
| 303 | Terrain sets the levels. Hills are Z1 ground (`world.deckHeight`); a valley floor is Z0. Roads keep their level: a Z1 road is a street on a hill and stands on columns only where the ground falls away under it | user-directed (26 October): "what if A2-B2-C2 is in a valley (ground level) and A1-B1-C1 are more +1 level because of topography so the highways look like roads in A1-B1-C1 but get columns in A2-B2-C2?" | A reason for every level change, as Zelda's mountains | Terrain floors, cliff faces and climbing roads are new to the kit | `prototypes/p5/docs/p65_valley_sections.png` |
| 304 | Network logic for district plans: every road goes somewhere (edge to edge, or to a junction); roads follow the terrain (arterial in the valley, ridge roads on hilltops, bridges hill to hill); levels meet where the terrain allows (a cove whose floor ramps up; public escalators; buildings with doors on two levels); the circus sits where the valley road meets the climbs | proposed (assistant, 26 October), from the user's "There must have some kind of city planning logic around the circus." | Each road and junction has a reason the player can read | — | `circus_valley.html` checks the plan against these |
| 305 | Circus · Valley plan: hills in rows 1 and 3 at Z1; the valley floor through row 2 (y 760–1160) at Z0; coves in B1 and B3 whose floor ramps 440 (27%); Valley Avenue (Z0) west–east through the circus; ridge roads at Z1 (y 240, 1680); west and east bridges (x 400, 2000) linking them, on columns over the valley only (span 396); climbs from the circus to T junctions in B1 and B3; T junctions where the bridges meet the ridge roads (A1, C1, A3, C3); public escalators on both valley walls in A2 and C2 | proposed (assistant, 26 October) | All rules hold (page checks) | Climbs need cars that change level (D35) | `prototypes/p5/circus_valley.html`; `docs/p65_valley_plan.png` |
| 306 | Street zebras removed (Circus B2's arms; decision 227). Parapet zebras stay (decisions 272, 289): they mark where the dummy steps onto a highway. Closes D33 | user-directed (26 October): "Decision - remove zebras". Keeping parapet zebras is the assistant's reading of D33 | No mark that promises a rule the game lacks | — | `prototypes/p5/docs/p66_circus_b2_no_zebras.png` |
| 307 | Circus · Valley, south side: a riverbank. Row 2 runs cliff, Valley Avenue, beach. Row 3: a coastal drive at Z0 on the seawall, horizontal, 45°, horizontal (inland under the bridges, out to the water in front of the circus); the river below. The two Z1 roads run straight south over the drive and the river, with no horizontal Z1 link south of the hill. The circus's south arm becomes the beach road, meeting the drive at a T in B3. Closes D34 | user-directed (26 October): "the south side is a riverbank with bridges carrying on over the river ... the +0 road branches into a 'riverside coastal drive' which winds in horizontal-45 degree-horizontal way ... with the two vertical +1 highways passing over the coastal drive, with a drop to the river below." Drive geometry, seawall line and the beach road are the assistant's | Every road still goes somewhere; the bridges carry the hill's traffic to the far bank | — | `circus_valley.html`; `docs/p66_valley_river_plan.png` |
| 308 | The river surface lies below the seawall (half a level). Water, not a floor: the one thing below Z0. Beach sand drawn as pale stone, never yellow (Edit 37) | proposed (assistant, 26 October), from "with a drop to the river below" | The drop reads | Falling in needs a rule (D37) | — |
| 309 | Shadows: option 2. One mask per receiving level (hill Z1, land Z0, river). Each caster stamps onto every lower level, offset by height difference × `proto.art.shadowScale`, clipped to that level. Solids sweep base to top; decks and walkways are slabs; terrain casts (hill onto valley, land onto river). Moving objects take a noon blob. Closes D36 | user-directed (26 October): "D36 - option 2 (recommended)" | Correct on every flat level at today's cost | Not yet in P5 game art; the valley plan draws it | `prototypes/p5/docs/p67_valley_tunnel_plan.png` |
| 310 | Circus: no ramps. The North Climb becomes the North Tunnel (Z0): up the level cove, into the hill at the cove head (B1, y 360), under the ridge road and the edge wall to the north edge. B1's T junction removed. Stairs up both cove walls (`world.stairLength`, `world.stairWidth`). Closes D35 | user-directed (26 October): "B1 - +0 road disappears into a tunnel ... B1 has staircase going up the cliff on both sides ... D35 - no it's not a ramp" | Roads keep one level; the circus keeps four arms | Tunnel art (row 311) | `circus_valley.html` |
