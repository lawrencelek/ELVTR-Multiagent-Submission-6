[EDIT92#3] 3 Story: Narrative A, Certified (replaces the proposal)
## 3 Story: Narrative A, Certified (replaces the proposal)
```markdown
- **Logline:** a dummy sits the longest job interview in the world. Passing means being shipped.
- **Tone:** dry corporate comedy. Farsight narrates. You are the product under test.
- **Voice:** polite, procedural, dry. No exclamation marks. Cars are colleagues; briefs are duties; parts are equipment.
- **Act I · Monument · INDUCTION:** off the factory floor; Farsight greets you as new staff.
  - Turn (C3): the gateway thanks a car for driving safely, seconds after it wrote you off. ROLE: DESTRUCTIVE TESTING.
- **Act II · Parkland · OPENING DAY:** the Expo opens when the park passes. Nine tiles, nine days. Visitors are booked.
  - Turn (B2): the board applauds the cars. "The public prefers the product to the test."
- **Act III · Waterfront · CUSTOMS:** the river is a border; ships wait beyond it.
  - The customs log (A3): ORIGIN OVERSEAS · DECLARED VALUE ONE UNIT · PURPOSE DESTRUCTION.
  - The circus (B2): the monument, cast from every chassis you lost. ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS).
- **Delivery (built):** the act line on each district's first card and at the head of every card; the map's act numerals (I, II, III); 27 tales; the ending.
```

[STORY#S1] S1 Story rules
## S1 Story rules
- Numbers live in the registry: tasks and gifts name parameter IDs, never values.
- A task tests the hit that writes the chassis off (the fatal hit).
- Tile names are column-row, as in the game: A1 is the top-left tile.
- Each tile's write-offs are story.writeOffs.<district>.<tile> in the registry (Edit 82).
- Edit 93: introduce, then test. A part arrives on the tile whose brief first needs it; no brief needs a part not yet issued. Monument: Battery 1 B1 (dash), Hands 1 A2 (cone), Legs 1 B3 (jump). Parkland: Arms 1 C1 (push), Legs 2 A3 (jump), Hands 2 A2 (cone), Arms 2 A1 (push), Battery 2 B2 (combo). Waterfront: Legs 3 B1 (jump), Arms 3 B3 (push), Battery 3 B2 (combo).
- Edit 92: Narrative A, Certified. Act I Monument (Induction), Act II Parkland (Opening Day), Act III Waterfront (Customs). Farsight narrates: polite, procedural, dry; no exclamation marks. The cars are colleagues; the briefs are duties; the parts are equipment.
- A gift rides in on the drone that carries the dummy into its tile (Edit 84). Arcade sells every part for credits; its chassis ships with Battery 1 (Edit 91).
- Each tile's traffic is story.traffic.<district>.<tile> in the registry, on the tile and its neighbours (Edit 85).

[STORY#S3] S3 Briefs
## S3 Briefs
A brief is a caps label, then "Coverage gap: …. The final hit must ….". Figures are placeholders bound to registry IDs ({n}).
| Kind | Label | Brief |
|---|---|---|
| any | ANY WRITE-OFF | General coverage. Any write-off in this tile counts. |
| dash | DASH INTO A CAR | Coverage gap: dashes. The final hit must be a dash into a car. |
| drop | DROP ONTO A CAR | Coverage gap: falls. The final hit must be a drop onto a car from above. |
| jump | JUMP INTO A CAR | Coverage gap: jumps. The final hit must be a jump into a car. |
| level | ON A RAISED ROAD | Coverage gap: raised roads. The final hit must land at Z1 or above. |
| cone | CONE-BAITED CAR | Coverage gap: cones. The final hit must come from a car reacting to a cone. |
| push | PUSH OFF A CAR | Coverage gap: ricochets. Push off one car; the final hit must be the next car. |
| bounce | THROWN INTO A CAR | Coverage gap: rebounds. The final hit must come while a hit is still throwing you. |
| struck | STRUCK, NOT DASHING | Coverage gap: pedestrians. The final hit must be a car hitting you while you walk or stand. |
| combo | COMBO ×{n} | Coverage gap: chains. The final hit must be link {n} or later of a combo. |
| cls | A {cls} | Coverage gap: the {clsLong}. The final hit must come from a {cls}. |

[EDIT39#4.1.1] 4.1.1 The register (replaces Edit 37)
## 4.1.1 The register (replaces Edit 37)
```markdown
#### 4.1.1 The register
**A Sinofuturist cyber city inside a friendly corporate terminal.** Two layers, never mixed.
- **The play area is the city at night.** 16-bit pixel art: dark deck plates, LED city blocks, neon spill, jersey barriers, a white fleet.
- **The frame is FARSIGHT's brand.** Dark glass, cyan LED edges, rounded panels. High resolution.
- **The contrast is the tone.** The city glows. The test writes off bodies in it. The brand never comments.
- **Dark ground rules every edge** (4.1.2). No sprite edge is black.
- **Reserved hues hold.** Yellow is the dummy. Red is the warning. Neon is material, never a cue.
- **Options:** day (Edit 37 eco-city) and night (parkland) remain as build palettes. Play never changes.
```

[FLEET#F2] F2 Voice
## F2 Voice
- Vehicles speak as workers, not lore narrators.
- Corporate politeness barely contains their personalities.
- Barks react to logged events only. Never claim what did not happen.
- Lines are at most 48 characters, end with . ! or ?, and react to logged events only.
- **Banned words** (never in a line): kill, killed, die, died, dead, death, player, level, game, score, respawn, lives, Chongqing, Tesla, Toyota, BYD.

[FLEET#F3] F3 Terms
## F3 Terms
- **subject:** What FARSIGHT and the fleet call the dummy
- **write-off:** A destroyed body
- **chassis:** One body of the dummy
- **certification:** The fleet passing its test
- **retraining:** What a car fears most
- **dispatch:** The cars' management
- **route:** A car's planned path
- **bay:** Where a new chassis is issued

[EDIT93#3.1/tales-rewritten~2] Tales rewritten

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 531 | Tales rewritten where a brief or part moved: Monument B1, C1, B3, C3; Parkland C1, C3, A2, B1, B2; Waterfront A1, B2. Voice kept: no exclamation marks; C3 keeps ROLE: DESTRUCTIVE TESTING, Waterfront B2 ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS) | proposed (assistant) under row 520 | Each tale names the equipment the tile issues | — | ≤ 223 characters |
| 532 | Registry `edit93-2026-10-29`: no IDs added; the 27 `story.writeOffs.*` and `story.traffic.*` descriptions carry the new briefs (505 entries) | proposed (assistant) | Every statistic has an ID | — | `content/params/tuning.parameters.json` |
| 533 | The finale is the unveiling and the ship: the circus's monument shrouded until Waterfront B2 clears; its unveiling, with the plaque showing the run (chassis spent, points, best combo, time); a Farsight drone lifts the dummy over the river to the container ship at Waterfront B3, every crate carrying its face. The ending screen follows | user-decided: "Unveiling and ship" (29 October) | The reward for clearing is seen, not only read | Credits over the voyage and Second Market wait (D77) | Closes D76; GDD Edit 92 §3.2 |
| 534 | Assignment #5: a goal-oriented coding agent (`coder/`) reads the GDD, scans the code, detects gaps with executable probes, scores them, writes the code for the top one and re-scans after each write. An open D-item blocks a requirement; the loop stops when every requirement is met or blocked | proposed (assistant) | The agent builds only what the GDD specifies and a decision has settled | A blocked requirement waits for Lawrence | `coder/coder.py` |
| 535 | The finale as built (Edit 94, P7.13): the circus's monument shrouded in Story until Waterfront B2 clears (`world.monumentShroud`); the last write-off plays under the cloth; a drone lifts the cloth (`ui.finale.unveilSeconds`) and the plaque reads THE DUMMY MONUMENT · UNVEILED, ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS), chassis spent, points, best combo, time; A or a tap: a drone carries the dummy from B2 over the edge to the container ship at B3, every crate with its face; then CERTIFIED. Arcade has no finale | user-decided (row 533); requirements and code by the coding agent (coder/, run 20261029-105801); reviewed (assistant) | The reward for clearing is seen | Credits and Second Market wait (D77) | `test_p713.js`; closes the finale part of D76 |
| 536 | The agent's writes accepted with manual changes: the write-off plays before the unveiling (the agent cut it); a drone lifts the cloth over 1.2 s, the gift screen's hold (the agent swapped it at once); the plaque in the game's own panel and type, inside the field, with the device's prompt and a tap target (the agent drew its own text below the field, keys only); the voyage reads FARSIGHT DRONE and · DRONE; the shroud's registry entry filed under World | proposed (assistant, manual review) | The agent's probes test state; the screen needed a person | — | Separate commit after the agent's; all 11 requirements' probes still pass |
| 537 | R-BARK-TILE rejected: the agent's write replaced the district's name with the tile code in Story barks ("B2. I did not sign up for this."). It met its one probe, not the voice. Reverted; the requirement set to spec none | proposed (assistant, manual review) | Barks are written lines in each tier's voice, with the lore check | Barks still name the district | Raises D78 |
| 538 | Registry `edit94-2026-10-29`: `world.monumentShroud` (0; P7SIM 1; written by the agent), `ui.finale.unveilSeconds` (1.2 s; added in review). 507 entries | proposed (assistant) | Every statistic has an ID | — | `content/params/tuning.parameters.json` |
| 539 | "Farsight" in title case in every sentence-case string: barks, tales, briefs, act lines, the ending. A label set wholly in capitals keeps its caps (FARSIGHT DRONE). Supersedes the fleet canon's capitals (Edit 39; `check_lore.py`) | user-decided (29 October): "Farsight everywhere" | Edit 92's tales, Edits 93–94 and rows 533, 535 write Farsight | `check_lore.py`, `checks.py` and bark c024 still say FARSIGHT (D79) | `style/STYLE_GUIDE.md` V4 |
| 540 | The fleet canon's banned terms apply to diegetic text only: barks, tales, briefs, act lines, the ending, plaques. Menu chrome is exempt (NEW GAME, Edit 88; LEVEL UP, Edit 89) | user-decided (29 October): "Diegetic text only" | Menus are interface, not voice | `checks.py` still applies the ban to every string shown | `style/STYLE_GUIDE.md` V1 |

| 541 | "!" by speaker: Farsight never; cars in a shout-style bark or any Budget (04) bark | user-decided (29 October): "Shouts and Budget only" | 16 of 17 shipped "!" lines fit (12 shouts; 13 Budget) | b111 "It recharges when it hits us?!" (speech, tier-free) is a minor break | `style/STYLE_GUIDE.md` T2, T10 |
| 542 | Lines the style loop accepts stay in `style/runs/` as a demonstration. D78 stays open; the Monument tile barks are its proposal. No change to `fleet.json`, `story.json`, builds or tests | user-decided (29 October): "Runs only" | Merging needs a tile condition in `fleet.json`, `check_lore.py` and `game.js`, and a 7.13 rebuild | D78 not closed | `style/runs/` |

[STORY#WC2] WC2 Waterfront C2 · The east beach terrace
### WC2 Waterfront C2 · The east beach terrace
- **Tile:** Waterfront C2, 4 of 9 in the act's order. Act: ACT III · CUSTOMS.
- **Title (its landmark):** The east beach terrace.
- **Brief:** DROP ONTO A CAR. Coverage gap: falls. The final hit must be a drop onto a car from above.
- **Equipment issued here:** none.
- **Tale:** The terrace was built for tourists, then joggers, then sensors. From its rail you can see the ships in the estuary and the cranes that load them. Drop onto a car below. The ships will wait.

[STORY#MC1] MC1 Monument C1 · The LED drum
### MC1 Monument C1 · The LED drum
- **Tile:** Monument C1, 3 of 9 in the act's order. Act: ACT I · INDUCTION.
- **Title (its landmark):** The LED drum.
- **Brief:** DROP ONTO A CAR. Coverage gap: falls. The final hit must be a drop onto a car from above.
- **Equipment issued here:** none.
- **Tale:** The drum lights each bend before a car reaches it, so no colleague is ever surprised. Today one will be. The high road breaks its rail over the street below. Step off it onto a car. Gravity is company policy.

| # | Decision | Status | Reason | Trade-off | Evidence / result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 171 | `world.towerHeightMin` 220 → 288: every tower stands above Z2 | proposed (assistant, 21 October) | Towers and platforms read apart | Fewer tower heights | Registry |
| 172 | The bake keeps a start screen only if the bot's first write-off comes by 90 s; the bot stays on the ground | proposed (assistant, 21 October) | P3.3 layouts gave starts up to 145 s | Interchange needs 20 candidates | `tools/district_bake.js`; 15 kept of 39 |
| 173 | The registry takes Edit 44: version `edit44-2026-10-21` | proposed (assistant, 21 October) | Every new statistic has an ID | 5 new entries, 1 retired, 2 table columns added, 1 value changed, 4 palette rows retired | `content/params/tuning.parameters.json` |
| 174 | The content pipeline targets the current prototype by default (`--target p3`). Knowledge base: V29, GDD Edits 37–44, the decision log (a heading every ten rows), the prototype log and a FLEET canon page rebuilt from `content/db/fleet.json` each run: 464 chunks. Three types: city barks, places, drops | proposed (assistant, 21 October), for ELVTR Submission 4 | The content must fill gaps in the build being played | The P2.1 types stay under `--target p2` | `content/runs/20261021-015337` … `-024324` |
| 175 | Fleet lines may test `drop`, `dropZ`, `dropFrom`, `deck`, `plate` and `district`. At equal priority a line that names the situation outranks a generic one. The sim logs `dropZ` and `dropFrom` on a drop, and `h` and `fromKind` on a landing | proposed (assistant, 21 October) | A drop onto a car no longer gets a bumper line | Generic lines fire less in the city | `check_lore.py` claims `drop`, `highway`, `plate`, `dropFrom:roof` |
| 176 | Published generated content: 24 city barks (`c001`–`c024`), 5 district intros, 45 screen names, 3 level toasts (`places.json`), 5 drop-juice layers with 83 `proto.drops.*` parameters (`drops.json`). Generated GDD edits 45–47 | proposed (generated, designer review) | Each passed validators, `check_lore.py` and the critic | Screen names promise only what all three layouts have | `content/out/DUMMIES_GDD_Edit45–47_*.md` |
| 177 | Open: a dummy running off a roof ledge lands about 73 units from the road centre, on the pavement, so roof drops rarely reach a car. Tune drop reach (`movement.runSpeed` cap in a drop) or `world.buildingSetback` | open (found 21 October while staging Submission 4 screenshots) | Roof drops onto cars are the point of Z2 roofs | — | `sub4drop.py`; `prototypes/p3/sim.js` `startDrop` |
| 178 | A flyover's drawn deck (band top minus its lift: Z1 36, Z2 64) stands at least `world.deckTopClear` (128 units, four 16 px tiles) below the top screen edge. Applied in every district with flyovers (Interchange, CBD, Campus). Supersedes the river-row rule (band top ≥ 60 on row 1) | user-directed (21 October): "New rule for the interchange design - now the elevated road is right at the top of the screen which means when you come from above your character is already hidden. we need to make it so it is at least four 16x16px units away from the top of the screen." Applying it to CBD and Campus is the assistant's | A dummy entering from above shows before a deck hides it | Flyovers sit mid-screen: offsets 260–420 | Contract clause 24; `prototypes/p3/docs/p34_a3_compare.png`. P3.3: 12 of 15 flyover rows drew within four tiles of the top |
| 179 | A flyover band ends at least `world.deckBottomClear` (128) above the bottom edge | proposed (assistant, 21 October) | Decks pushed down by row 178 left strips too thin to build; block share failed | Fewer offsets per row | Contract clause 24; 10-seed smoke before and after |
| 180 | A building at a shared screen edge straddles it: at least `world.edgeOverlap` (32 units, one 16 px tile) into each screen, up to 64 into the neighbour; the same footprint, height and art on both screens | user-directed (21 October): "when buildings are right next to the edge of the screen in two consecutive slides, it is currently marked with a dotted line, but this isn't clear for the viewer. it should be one unit overlapping at least (16x16px)." Reach up to 64 and the shared sprite seed are the assistant's | The building shows on both screens, so the edge reads without a mark | Lots at edges depend on the neighbour's room | Contract clause 23; 19–37 straddling buildings per layout; `prototypes/p3/docs/p34_pair_compare.png` |
