- **Request (user, 29 October):** "Story mode - there is too much superfluous text in general."
  - A new introduction screen: DUMMIES, full screen, and Start. An animation: the dummy steps into the road in front of a car, front-on, in the upgrade screen's style. One line on what to do, quirky but obvious.
  - Mode select: STORY first. "Get your Dummy Certification in Shenzhen Smart City and learn about the Corporation." ARCADE: "Get hit in fun, creative, and destructive ways before the Vehicles run out!"
  - Starting a level, in either mode: a screen that says very simply what the goal is.
  - "You are dropped off from the left side of a screen by a DRONE. (Same as for ARCADE mode when you start a new map)"
  - The level card: "ACT I: MONUMENT. Tile A1. Level 1 of 27. / Story text. 15-20 words. / Then goal text."
  - Monument A1: "Fresh off the factory floor, you're ready to do some damage to yourself. Make your engineers proud!" Goal, in bold: ">>> Walk into the path of the incoming vehicles. Time your approach, and choose your angle carefully. Bonus points for combinations and lethal hits!"
  - Starting Story: an animation like the upgrade screen, the dummy's parts flying.
- **Rulings (user, 29 October):**
  - Voice stays deadpan: no "!" (Edit 95). The user's lines are used without it.
  - The drone drops the dummy at each level start: a Story tile deployed from the map; an Arcade district.
- **Readings flagged:**
  - Tales: 15 to 20 words, two sentences. Edit 97's 35 is withdrawn.
  - The user's lines are canon as written: A1's tale, A1's goal, the STORY and ARCADE card lines. A1's goal runs 23 words in three sentences, past the 20-word cap.
  - Goals replace briefs on the card: imperative, what to do. The caps label stays for the map and the objective strip.
  - Act lines leave the level card. They stay on the story map.
  - The Story animation plays when a story starts: NEW GAME or CONTINUE, before the map.

[STORY#S1] S1 Story rules
## S1 Story rules
- Numbers live in the registry: tasks and gifts name parameter IDs, never values.
- A task tests the hit that writes the chassis off (the fatal hit).
- Tile names are column-row, as in the game: A1 is the top-left tile.
- Each tile's write-offs are story.writeOffs.<district>.<tile> in the registry (Edit 82).
- Edit 93: introduce, then test. A part arrives on the tile whose brief first needs it; no brief needs a part not yet issued. Monument: Battery 1 B1 (dash), Hands 1 A2 (cone), Legs 1 B3 (jump). Parkland: Arms 1 C1 (push), Legs 2 A3 (jump), Hands 2 A2 (cone), Arms 2 A1 (push), Battery 2 B2 (combo). Waterfront: Legs 3 B1 (jump), Arms 3 B3 (push), Battery 3 B2 (combo).
- Edit 92: Narrative A, Certified. Act I Monument (Induction), Act II Parkland (Opening Day), Act III Waterfront (Customs). Farsight narrates: polite, procedural, dry; no exclamation marks. The cars are colleagues; the briefs are duties; the parts are equipment.
- A gift rides in on the drone that carries the dummy into its tile (Edit 84). Arcade sells every part for credits; its chassis ships with Battery 1 (Edit 91).
- Each tile's traffic is story.traffic.<district>.<tile> in the registry, on the tile and its neighbours (Edit 85).
