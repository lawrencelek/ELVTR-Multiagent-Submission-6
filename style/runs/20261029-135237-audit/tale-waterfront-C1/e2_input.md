## 3 Story: Narrative A, Certified (replaces the proposal)
```markdown
- **Logline:** a dummy sits the longest job interview in the world. Passing means being shipped.
- **Tone:** dry corporate comedy. Farsight narrates. You are the product under test.
- **Voice:** polite, procedural, dry. No exclamation marks. Cars are colleagues; briefs are duties; parts are equipment.
- **Act I · Monument · INDUCTION:** off the factory floor; Farsight greets you as new staff.
  - Turn (C3): the gateway thanks a car for driving safely, seconds after it wrote you off. ROLE: DESTRUCTIVE TESTING.
- **Act II · Parkland · OPENING DAY:** the Expo opens when the park passes. Nine tiles, nine days. Visitors are booked.
  - Turn (B2): the board applauds the cars. "The public prefers the product to the test."
- **Act III · Waterfront · CUSTOMS:** the river is a border; ships wait beyond it.
  - The customs log (A3): ORIGIN OVERSEAS · DECLARED VALUE ONE UNIT · PURPOSE DESTRUCTION.
  - The circus (B2): the monument, cast from every chassis you lost. ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS).
- **Delivery (built):** the act line on each district's first card and at the head of every card; the map's act numerals (I, II, III); 27 tales; the ending.
```

[STORY#S1] S1 Story rules
## S1 Story rules
- Numbers live in the registry: tasks and gifts name parameter IDs, never values.
- A task tests the hit that writes the chassis off (the fatal hit).
- Tile names are column-row, as in the game: A1 is the top-left tile.
- Each tile's write-offs are story.writeOffs.<district>.<tile> in the registry (Edit 82).
- Edit 93: introduce, then test. A part arrives on the tile whose brief first needs it; no brief needs a part not yet issued. Monument: Battery 1 B1 (dash), Hands 1 A2 (cone), Legs 1 B3 (jump). Parkland: Arms 1 C1 (push), Legs 2 A3 (jump), Hands 2 A2 (cone), Arms 2 A1 (push), Battery 2 B2 (combo). Waterfront: Legs 3 B1 (jump), Arms 3 B3 (push), Battery 3 B2 (combo).
- Edit 92: Narrative A, Certified. Act I Monument (Induction), Act II Parkland (Opening Day), Act III Waterfront (Customs). Farsight narrates: polite, procedural, dry; no exclamation marks. The cars are colleagues; the briefs are duties; the parts are equipment.
- A gift rides in on the drone that carries the dummy into its tile (Edit 84). Arcade sells every part for credits; its chassis ships with Battery 1 (Edit 91).
- Each tile's traffic is story.traffic.<district>.<tile> in the registry, on the tile and its neighbours (Edit 85).

[STORY#S3] S3 Briefs
## S3 Briefs
A brief is a caps label, then "Coverage gap: …. The final hit must ….". Figures are placeholders bound to registry IDs ({n}).
| Kind | Label | Brief |
|---|---|---|
| any | ANY WRITE-OFF | General coverage. Any write-off in this tile counts. |
| dash | DASH INTO A CAR | Coverage gap: dashes. The final hit must be a dash into a car. |
| drop | DROP ONTO A CAR | Coverage gap: falls. The final hit must be a drop onto a car from above. |
| jump | JUMP INTO A CAR | Coverage gap: jumps. The final hit must be a jump into a car. |
| level | ON A RAISED ROAD | Coverage gap: raised roads. The final hit must land at Z1 or above. |
| cone | CONE-BAITED CAR | Coverage gap: cones. The final hit must come from a car reacting to a cone. |
| push | PUSH OFF A CAR | Coverage gap: ricochets. Push off one car; the final hit must be the next car. |
| bounce | THROWN INTO A CAR | Coverage gap: rebounds. The final hit must come while a hit is still throwing you. |
| struck | STRUCK, NOT DASHING | Coverage gap: pedestrians. The final hit must be a car hitting you while you walk or stand. |

## 4.1.1 The register (replaces Edit 37)
```markdown
#### 4.1.1 The register
**A Sinofuturist cyber city inside a friendly corporate terminal.** Two layers, never mixed.
- **The play area is the city at night.** 16-bit pixel art: dark deck plates, LED city blocks, neon spill, jersey barriers, a white fleet.
- **The frame is FARSIGHT's brand.** Dark glass, cyan LED edges, rounded panels. High resolution.
- **The contrast is the tone.** The city glows. The test writes off bodies in it. The brand never comments.
- **Dark ground rules every edge** (4.1.2). No sprite edge is black.
- **Reserved hues hold.** Yellow is the dummy. Red is the warning. Neon is material, never a cue.
- **Options:** day (Edit 37 eco-city) and night (parkland) remain as build palettes. Play never changes.
```

[FLEET#F2] F2 Voice

| 531 | Tales rewritten where a brief or part moved: Monument B1, C1, B3, C3; Parkland C1, C3, A2, B1, B2; Waterfront A1, B2. Voice kept: no exclamation marks; C3 keeps ROLE: DESTRUCTIVE TESTING, Waterfront B2 ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS) | proposed (assistant) under row 520 | Each tale names the equipment the tile issues | — | ≤ 223 characters |
| 532 | Registry `edit93-2026-10-29`: no IDs added; the 27 `story.writeOffs.*` and `story.traffic.*` descriptions carry the new briefs (505 entries) | proposed (assistant) | Every statistic has an ID | — | `content/params/tuning.parameters.json` |
| 533 | The finale is the unveiling and the ship: the circus's monument shrouded until Waterfront B2 clears; its unveiling, with the plaque showing the run (chassis spent, points, best combo, time); a Farsight drone lifts the dummy over the river to the container ship at Waterfront B3, every crate carrying its face. The ending screen follows | user-decided: "Unveiling and ship" (29 October) | The reward for clearing is seen, not only read | Credits over the voyage and Second Market wait (D77) | Closes D76; GDD Edit 92 §3.2 |
| 534 | Assignment #5: a goal-oriented coding agent (`coder/`) reads the GDD, scans the code, detects gaps with executable probes, scores them, writes the code for the top one and re-scans after each write. An open D-item blocks a requirement; the loop stops when every requirement is met or blocked | proposed (assistant) | The agent builds only what the GDD specifies and a decision has settled | A blocked requirement waits for Lawrence | `coder/coder.py` |
| 535 | The finale as built (Edit 94, P7.13): the circus's monument shrouded in Story until Waterfront B2 clears (`world.monumentShroud`); the last write-off plays under the cloth; a drone lifts the cloth (`ui.finale.unveilSeconds`) and the plaque reads THE DUMMY MONUMENT · UNVEILED, ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS), chassis spent, points, best combo, time; A or a tap: a drone carries the dummy from B2 over the edge to the container ship at B3, every crate with its face; then CERTIFIED. Arcade has no finale | user-decided (row 533); requirements and code by the coding agent (coder/, run 20261029-105801); reviewed (assistant) | The reward for clearing is seen | Credits and Second Market wait (D77) | `test_p713.js`; closes the finale part of D76 |
| 536 | The agent's writes accepted with manual changes: the write-off plays before the unveiling (the agent cut it); a drone lifts the cloth over 1.2 s, the gift screen's hold (the agent swapped it at once); the plaque in the game's own panel and type, inside the field, with the device's prompt and a tap target (the agent drew its own text below the field, keys only); the voyage reads FARSIGHT DRONE and · DRONE; the shroud's registry entry filed under World | proposed (assistant, manual review) | The agent's probes test state; the screen needed a person | — | Separate commit after the agent's; all 11 requirements' probes still pass |
| 537 | R-BARK-TILE rejected: the agent's write replaced the district's name with the tile code in Story barks ("B2. I did not sign up for this."). It met its one probe, not the voice. Reverted; the requirement set to spec none | proposed (assistant, manual review) | Barks are written lines in each tier's voice, with the lore check | Barks still name the district | Raises D78 |
| 538 | Registry `edit94-2026-10-29`: `world.monumentShroud` (0; P7SIM 1; written by the agent), `ui.finale.unveilSeconds` (1.2 s; added in review). 507 entries | proposed (assistant) | Every statistic has an ID | — | `content/params/tuning.parameters.json` |
| 539 | "Farsight" in title case in every sentence-case string: barks, tales, briefs, act lines, the ending. A label set wholly in capitals keeps its caps (FARSIGHT DRONE). Supersedes the fleet canon's capitals (Edit 39; `check_lore.py`) | user-decided (29 October): "Farsight everywhere" | Edit 92's tales, Edits 93–94 and rows 533, 535 write Farsight | `check_lore.py`, `checks.py` and bark c024 still say FARSIGHT (D79) | `style/STYLE_GUIDE.md` V4 |
| 540 | The fleet canon's banned terms apply to diegetic text only: barks, tales, briefs, act lines, the ending, plaques. Menu chrome is exempt (NEW GAME, Edit 88; LEVEL UP, Edit 89) | user-decided (29 October): "Diegetic text only" | Menus are interface, not voice | `checks.py` still applies the ban to every string shown | `style/STYLE_GUIDE.md` V1 |

(speech, tier-free) is a minor break | `style/STYLE_GUIDE.md` T2, T10 |

No change to `fleet.json`, `story.json`, builds or tests | user-decided (29 October): "Runs only" | Merging needs a tile condition in `fleet.json`, `check_lore.py` and `game.js`, and a 7.13 rebuild | D78 not closed | `style/runs/` |
| 543 | Assignment #6: the Style Guide Agent (`style/`). A style guide from the GDD (tone, vocabulary and lore, formatting and length, truth; every rule cites its chunk); a deterministic lint as evidence; a loop of three fresh agents, generator → evaluator → refiner → evaluator, until 10/10 or three refinements. The evaluator returns SCORE and REASON. Its statistics live in `style/style.params.json` until the registry moves past edit94 (the P7.13 suite gates the version) | proposed (assistant) | The brief: a capstone-anchored guide; no binary grading; no human in the loop | Style IDs sit outside `tuning.parameters.json` for now | `style/README.md` |

[STORY#WC1] WC1 Waterfront C1 · The east portal
### WC1 Waterfront C1 · The east portal
- **Tile:** Waterfront C1, 3 of 9 in the act's order. Act: ACT III · CUSTOMS.
- **Title (its landmark):** The east portal.
- **Brief:** A POLICE CAR. Coverage gap: the police fleet. The final hit must come from a police car.
- **Equipment issued here:** none.
- **Tale:** The east bridge was built a year after the west, to correct its mistakes. Its portal block faces the other way and pretends not to know its twin. The police here check papers. Yours are being prepared.

[EDIT92#3.1~2] 3.1 The 27 tiles
| # | Tile | Title | Brief | Part | Tale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Monument A1 | The welcome wall | Any | — | A conveyor sets you down beside a tower. Its screen shows your face and the word WELCOME. Farsight is pleased to have you. Your first duty is simple: stand in the road until a colleague notices you. |
| 2 | Monument B1 | The podium bridge | Drop | Battery 1 | Your first equipment has arrived: a battery, for the dash. The skybridge was built for shoppers who never came; it now serves as an observation deck for staff. Observe a car from above, then join it. |
| 3 | Monument C1 | The LED drum | Jump | Legs 1 | The drum lights each bend before a car reaches it, so no colleague is ever surprised. Today you will surprise one. Legs 1 is fitted for the purpose. Your enthusiasm will be noted in your file. |
| 4 | Monument C2 | The portal tower | Raised road | — | The high road runs through this tower at the sixth floor. The tenants say the traffic is good company. Today your duty is on the road itself, at height. The view is not part of the job. |
| 5 | Monument B2 | The monument | Struck | — | The plaque reads ZERO ACCIDENTS. New staff ask whether this is a record. It is a target. Stand near it and let a colleague find you. Walking is permitted. Dashing would spoil the data. |
| 6 | Monument A2 | The neon shops | Cone | Hands 1 | The shops under the highway sell nothing. Their signs flash prices at the traffic, which reads every word. Hands 1 is fitted, so you can place a cone. Colleagues are trained to respect cones. Use this. |
| 7 | Monument A3 | The stacked cubes | Combo ×2 | — | Each cube was added as the budget arrived, one quarter at a time, each leaning further than the last. Farsight calls this growth. Today's duty is the same: one hit, then another before the first is forgotten. |
| 8 | Monument B3 | The LED canyon | Jump | — | Two screens face each other across the road and advertise to each other all night. The skybridge was added so that someone would watch. You are now someone. Jump into a car between the screens. |
| 9 | Monument C3 | The LED gateway | Push | Arms 1 | The gateway thanks every car for driving safely. It thanked the last one seconds after that car wrote you off. Your file is updated: ROLE: DESTRUCTIVE TESTING. Arms 1 is fitted. Push off one colleague into the next. |
| 10 | Parkland C1 | The lantern pavilion | Drop | Battery 2 | The paper lantern was the Expo's first exhibit, and it is lit again for the visitors. Battery 2 is fitted: a second charge. Farsight calls it safety equipment. Drop onto a car from the footbridge. |
| 11 | Parkland C2 | The amphitheatre | Van | — | Farsight's board will watch from these terraces on opening day. The seats face the avenue, so every crossing is a performance. A van delivers the catering. Arrange for it to deliver you. |
| 12 | Parkland C3 | The arch and the roundabout | Thrown | — | The arch is the Expo's gate. Visitors will circle the roundabout once before they enter, which gives the cars time to learn them. You go round faster. Be thrown into a car while the last one still throws you. |
| 13 | Parkland B3 | The obelisk court | Police | — | The obelisk marks the surveyors' first stake. A school party will visit it on opening day, escorted by the police fleet. Farsight would like to know how the police fleet handles a dummy first. |
| 14 | Parkland A3 | The belvedere | Jump | Legs 2 | A wedding is booked on the belvedere for opening day. The couple asked for a view of the traffic. Legs 2 is fitted: longer in the air. Land on a car here, so that no guest ever does. |
| 15 | Parkland A2 | The dome by the canal | Raised road | — | The dome is the Expo's showroom. The canal beside it cools the highway's footings; the ducks are registered volunteers. On opening day the visitors will look up at the highway. Be on it. |
| 16 | Parkland A1 | The reservoir terraces | Push | Arms 2 | The gardener keeps the three pools level by hand. She has asked that the cars learn to stop before the water. Arms 2 is fitted: a stronger push. Teach them by hitting one car into the next. |
| 17 | Parkland B1 | The cascade | Cone | Hands 2 | The cascade steps the reservoir's water down beside the highway, pool by pool. It was built to drown out the traffic. Hands 2 is fitted: two cones. Lay them where the visitors will walk, and see who stops. |
| 18 | Parkland B2 | The ring over the pools | Combo ×3 | — | Inspection day. The board watches the ring. When the cars come round clean, the board applauds the cars. Farsight notes that the public prefers the product to the test. Give the board a chain of three. |
| 19 | Waterfront A1 | The west portal | Bus | Battery 3 | The upper town houses the engineers, and the bus carries them to the bridge. Battery 3 is fitted: a faster recharge. Farsight requires the bus fleet's data before anyone crosses the river. |
| 20 | Waterfront B1 | The tunnel portal | Jump | Legs 3 | The tunnel runs north under the hill to the next valley. Cars go in. Data comes back. Legs 3 is fitted: the longest flight. Where your data goes after the tunnel is not within your role. |
| 21 | Waterfront C1 | The east portal | Police | — | The east bridge was built a year after the west, to correct its mistakes. Its portal block faces the other way and pretends not to know its twin. The police here check papers. Yours are being prepared. |
| 22 | Waterfront C2 | The east beach terrace | Drop | — | The terrace was built for tourists, then joggers, then sensors. From its rail you can see the ships in the estuary and the cranes that load them. Drop onto a car below. The ships will wait. |
| 23 | Waterfront C3 | The east customs post | Thrown | — | The pier tower is a customs post. It logs everything that floats on the river: containers, ducks and, so far, one dummy, inbound. Be thrown into a car. Customs is watching. |
| 24 | Waterfront B3 | The stilt houses | Push | Arms 3 | The stilt houses are older than the city, kept as heritage. Behind glass in one of them stands Chassis 0, the prototype before you. A ship is moored beyond. Arms 3 is fitted. Show Chassis 0 how far the model has come. |
| 25 | Waterfront A3 | The west customs post | Raised road | — | The west tower keeps the customs log. Your entry reads ORIGIN OVERSEAS · DECLARED VALUE ONE UNIT · PURPOSE DESTRUCTION. You were shipped here to be tested. Honour the declaration on the raised road. |
| 26 | Waterfront A2 | The west beach terrace | Cone | — | The valley began here: a cliff, an avenue, and a beach of sand brought from three provinces. The ceremony is being prepared in the circus. Place a cone. Farsight would like one more clean reading before the speeches. |
| 27 | Waterfront B2 | The circus | Combo ×3 | — | Everything in the valley meets here. On the island stands the monument, cast from every chassis you lost. Its plaque reads ZERO ACCIDENTS (EXCLUDING TESTS). One last chain of three certifies the city. And you. |

- **Act I's other briefs** test what the body already does: drop, raised road, struck, combo ×2, thrown.
- **Parkland B1** (D70): its street is empty 67% of the time. A raised road replaces the cone. The highway always carries cars.
