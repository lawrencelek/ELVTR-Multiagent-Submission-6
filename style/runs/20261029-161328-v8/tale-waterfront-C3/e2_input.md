[EDIT95#0] 0 Request and rulings
## 0 Request and rulings
- **Request (user, 29 October):**
  - "The game itself is published by Farsight. (Extra-diegetic). Farsight is NOT mentioned inside the game. Only in Credits."
  - "Within the game, the company is only known as Dummy Corporation. Manufacturers of custom dummies for high net-worth individuals."
  - "The tone is deadpan and inspirational, concise sentences, fewer adjectives. All text reports and in-game texts should be concise, and even the longest explanations should have maximum two sentences, or 15-20 words max."
  - "The environmental storytelling is there to inspire the Dummy to do their job, and fulfil their training, so that they can in future join the ranks of Certified dummies and to be sacrificed in service to the high net-worth individuals."
  - Tone reference: *Play Station* (Lawrence Lek, 2017), `style/kb/DUMMIES_Play_Station_Script_2017.md`.
- **Rulings (user, 29 October):** the publisher credit sits on a Credits card, on the title menu and after the CERTIFIED ending. Prototype 8 lives in the working repository only.
- **Readings flagged:**
  - "15-20 words max" is read as a cap of 20 words, with 15 as the aim. "Maximum two sentences" holds as well.
  - "Deadpan" keeps Edit 92's rule: no exclamation marks in the company's voice. The 2017 script's "!" is not adopted.
  - The cars keep their tier voices (Edit 39 §6.6). Their barks fall under the same caps: at most two sentences.
  - Gameplay, briefs' tasks, parts, write-offs and traffic are unchanged. Only text changes.

[STORY#S1] S1 Story rules
## S1 Story rules
- Numbers live in the registry: tasks and gifts name parameter IDs, never values.
- A task tests the hit that writes the chassis off (the fatal hit).
- Tile names are column-row, as in the game: A1 is the top-left tile.
- Each tile's write-offs are story.writeOffs.<district>.<tile> in the registry (Edit 82).
- Edit 93: introduce, then test. A part arrives on the tile whose brief first needs it; no brief needs a part not yet issued. Monument: Battery 1 B1 (dash), Hands 1 A2 (cone), Legs 1 B3 (jump). Parkland: Arms 1 C1 (push), Legs 2 A3 (jump), Hands 2 A2 (cone), Arms 2 A1 (push), Battery 2 B2 (combo). Waterfront: Legs 3 B1 (jump), Arms 3 B3 (push), Battery 3 B2 (combo).
- Edit 92: Narrative A, Certified. Act I Monument (Induction), Act II Parkland (Opening Day), Act III Waterfront (Customs). Farsight narrates: polite, procedural, dry; no exclamation marks. The cars are colleagues; the briefs are duties; the parts are equipment.
- A gift rides in on the drone that carries the dummy into its tile (Edit 84). Arcade sells every part for credits; its chassis ships with Battery 1 (Edit 91).
- Each tile's traffic is story.traffic.<district>.<tile> in the registry, on the tile and its neighbours (Edit 85).
