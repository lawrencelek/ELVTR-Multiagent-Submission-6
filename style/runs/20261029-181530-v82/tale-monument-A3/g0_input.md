[STORY#S1] S1 Story rules
## S1 Story rules
- Numbers live in the registry: tasks and gifts name parameter IDs, never values.
- A task tests the hit that writes the chassis off (the fatal hit).
- Tile names are column-row, as in the game: A1 is the top-left tile.
- Each tile's write-offs are story.writeOffs.<district>.<tile> in the registry (Edit 82).
- Edit 93: introduce, then test. A part arrives on the tile whose brief first needs it; no brief needs a part not yet issued. Monument: Battery 1 B1 (dash), Hands 1 A2 (cone), Legs 1 B3 (jump). Parkland: Arms 1 C1 (push), Legs 2 A3 (jump), Hands 2 A2 (cone), Arms 2 A1 (push), Battery 2 B2 (combo). Waterfront: Legs 3 B1 (jump), Arms 3 B3 (push), Battery 3 B2 (combo).
- Edit 92: Narrative A, Certified. Act I Monument (Induction), Act II Parkland (Opening Day), Act III Waterfront (Customs). Farsight narrates: polite, procedural, dry; no exclamation marks. The cars are colleagues; the briefs are duties; the parts are equipment.
- A gift rides in on the drone that carries the dummy into its tile (Edit 84). Arcade sells every part for credits; its chassis ships with Battery 1 (Edit 91).
- Each tile's traffic is story.traffic.<district>.<tile> in the registry, on the tile and its neighbours (Edit 85).

| 271 | Portal tower: a highway may run through a tower at deck level. The opening rises `world.portalClearance` (72) above the deck; the tower rises at least two storeys over it. Cars drive through unchanged. Mock-up: Monument C2, the Z2 highway through a 12-storey tower | user idea (25 October): "can there be a highway that runs through through buildings? ... This is a really cool Chongqing-style idea." Values proposed | A Chongqing set piece: the highway enters the city's fabric | Buildings may straddle a deck band only as a portal | `prototypes/p5/docs/p59_chongqing.png` |

P6: one Edit 44 bridge floor spans the parapet (no new mechanic). Mock-up: Monument C2, a six-storey roof plaza off the Z2 highway's west parapet; an escalator drops from the plaza to the street. C2 keeps two escalators | user idea (25 October): "You can walk from building roof to highway." Placement proposed | Highway, roof and street join as one walk | C2's west deck escalator moves to the plaza | `prototypes/p5/docs/p59_chongqing.png` |
| 273 | Every tile carries a set piece: scenography, a change of level, or both. Change of level: a deck, ring, footbridge, skybridge, walkway, roof plaza, terraces or a sunken court on screen. Scenography: a landmark at least `world.deckWidth` (160) across or rising past `world.highHeight` (216). The district plan lists each tile's set piece | user-directed (25 October): "for level design each individual level tile should visual interest from scenography and/or change of level." The tests are the assistant's | No filler tile | Some tiles rely on scenography alone (Circus rows 1–2) | Audit: 27 of 27 tiles pass; the page warns on a tile without its set piece |
| 274 | Mock-up: four weak tiles redrawn. Parkland A3: a belvedere, four one-storey tiers and a stair to a lawn with the monolith orchard. Parkland C3: the sculpture court sunk three lit steps. Monument A3: stacked LED cubes, each cantilevered, on a lit plaza. Monument B3: a Z1 skybridge across the jog at 90° between the two LED walls | proposed (assistant, 25 October), under 273 | Each tile reads at grid scale | More drawing per tile | `prototypes/p5/docs/p59_tile_set_pieces.png` |

Three-way 45° junctions stay | user-requested example (25 October): "these 45 degree intersections are really awkward when they form a cross ... Give me 4 options as a separate example (do not implement yet)." Options from road design practice (Iowa DOT 6A-8, AASHTO, Essex Design Guide, WisDOT FDM 11-26) | Guides realign anything under 60°; 45° is below every minimum | Each costs space (A, C), a block of shared road (B) or turns between the roads (D) | `prototypes/p5/crossing_options.html`; `docs/crossing_report.md` |

Large: a great lawn over the largest free block of garden cells, `world.gardenLargeCells` (2) square or one cell more each way, framed by a clipped hedge; one per tile where room allows; a tile's set piece also anchors. Medium: one-cell beds only where they frame the lawn or the set piece, at most `world.gardenBedTypes` (2) types. Small: planters `world.gardenPlanter` (40) across, two to each open square and one at each lawn corner. Amends 243 (beds no longer fill every cell at random) | user-directed (25 October): "the parkland looks ugly because the plant boxes are piece meal. There should be a pleasing hierarchy between small, medium, and large parkland and planting units."

A sculpture court, at grade: one large piece at `world.sculptureScaleLarge` (2×) on the axis, two medium pieces either side, `world.courtSmallCount` (7) lit bollards along the front edge (`world.sculptureScaleSmall`, 0.5). Garden path crossings carry medium pieces only. Parkland B3 and C3 become courts | user-directed (25 October): "Again there should be a small, medium, large hierarchy of sculptural elements."

REQUEST
Redraft the tale for Monument A3 (The stacked cubes). Two earlier versions are source material: use any of their facts and jokes, copy neither whole.
- Prototype 7.13 (Farsight's voice; Farsight must not appear): Each cube was added as the budget arrived, one quarter at a time, each leaning further than the last. Farsight calls this growth. Today's duty is the same: one hit, then another before the first is forgotten.
- Prototype 8.1 (Dummy Corporation): Each stacked cube was added as the budget arrived, one on the last; we call this growth. Your duty grows the same way: one hit, then another before the first is forgotten.
Choose the length the tile needs, 15 to 35 words in at most two sentences: short when one image carries it, longer when the place has a history worth telling. Name the place, keep the duty and any equipment the tile issues, and point the place at the training.
